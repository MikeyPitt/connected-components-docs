# Zeplin Connected Components Documentation üß©

In Zeplin, Connected Components enables developers to access component code directly on the designs‚Äì‚Äìin addition you can include a pathway to Storybook, GitHub, your design system or any other source of documentation.

After connecting your components in Zeplin to your components in code, you'll get a high level overview of the component right on the designs, like so:
